- 👋 Hi, I’m @namakemonoLA
- 👀 I’m interested in music, crochet, video games, writing, and sloths.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that can help people! I have a background in education, so I think I can be especially helpful in making educational tools. I also want to work on games! I am currently working freelance as a script writer for visual novels :)
